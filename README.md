I possess solid skills in web development using PHP and am currently exploring the potential integration between SaaS and IoT. My experience as an Electrical Engineer provides a strong foundation in instrumentation, control and explore microcontrollers with programming languages. I have a vision to merge this knowledge in innovative projects in the future.
